## Hello there, I am Daniel :shipit:

üå± An (B.Sc.) Environmental engineer here!  

üõ∞Ô∏è Strongly interested in geospatial technologies applied to environmental and territorial analysis, monitoring of natural resources and disaster assesment; I've been learning and using different GIS software, Remote Sensing techniques and discovering new data sources, programming tools and different resources for setting a proper workflow focused in geospatial analysis. I'm getting into the programming/modeling world with Python, Javascript and R, desiring to improve my skills not just in usage but testing, supporting and creating tools. I'd love to get involved in some interesting project to build my skills and profile as a researcher (starting this journey yet)

My interests within the ***environmental sciences*** universe:
- Territorial planning, *Land-use cover*. 
- Hydrology&Hydraulics (open channels flow and pipe flow), Hydrogeology (aquifers) and Basin analysis.
- Climatology, Climate change, Air quality, Weather dynamics and its local impacts.

Thanks for reading, feel free to contact me if you have any comment, suggestion or resource to share with me or any project you think I could join :)
